- Hi, I’m asadava (all lowercase), a not-so expert Python and HTML "programmer"...
- I’m interested in making useless things you can run in Visual Studio Code, sometimes other programs, and the occasional HTML page.
- I’m currently learning Python, and HTML I do somewhat nowadays.
- I started learning Python on September 3rd, 2021, and HTML during about late 2018.

### --- QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ---
Q: Why are there a bunch of comments jam packed into your code?<br/>
A: This code was not made for GitHub, it was made to show my friends and family who don't know python how these programs tick.

Q: Why are you called asadava?<br/>
A: I found my dad's drug stash, and the rest is history.

Q: How do I learn programming?<br/>
A: What I used to start learning HTML was Sololearn. Nowadays, they messed it up with it being (somewhat) pay-to-win, so be wary.
