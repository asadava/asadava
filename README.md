- Hi, I’m asadava (all lowercase), a not-so expert Python and HTML "programmer"...
- I’m interested in making useless things you can run in Visual Studio Code, and the occasional HTML page.
- I’m currently learning Python, and HTML I do somewhat nowadays.
- I started learning Python on September 3rd, 2021, and HTML during about late 2018.
- I can't wait to start wasting my life on this, when I get my Raspberry Pi 400 in the next few days!

Here is a crappy program I made. Cool, right? Right?
