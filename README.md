- hi, I’m asadava (all lowercase), a not-so expert python and HTML "programmer"...
- i’m interested in making useless things you can run in visual studio code, sometimes other programs, and the occasional HTML page.
- i’m currently learning python, and HTML I do somewhat nowadays.
- i started learning python on september 3rd, 2021, and HTML during about late 2018.

### --- QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ---
Q: why are there a bunch of comments jam packed into your code?<br/>
A: this code was not made for github, it was made to show my friends and family who don't know python how these programs tick.

Q: why are you called bushfactoryz?<br/>
A: I found my dad's drug stash, and the rest is history.

Q: how do i learn programming?<br/>
A: what i used to start learning HTML was sololearn. but, any tutorial website/video/whatever will probably work.
