- hellough! i’m bushfactory (aka asadava) (all lowercase), a not-so expert python and HTML "programmer"...
- i’m interested in making useless things you can run in visual studio code, sometimes other programs, and the occasional website.
- i’ve learned python and html, if you ask me to do anything other than those i will cry myself to sleep.
- i learned python in 2021 and HTML around late 2018.

### --- QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ---
Q: why are there a bunch of comments jam packed into your code?<br/>
A: this code wasn't made for github, it was made to show my friends and family who don't know python how these programs tick.

Q: why are you called bushfactory?<br/>
A: i found my dad's drug stash, and the rest is history...

Q: how do i learn programming?<br/>
A: what i used to start learning HTML was sololearn. but, any tutorial website/video/whatever will probably work.
